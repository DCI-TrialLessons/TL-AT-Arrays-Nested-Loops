# Programming Basics: Arrays and Nested Loops

Create a file called `main.js` and use Ã„nested loops* in each of your solutions:

## Q1. Print the following pattern to the console:  
```
*
* *  
* * *  
* * * *  
```

## Q2. Given the following array:
```
const arr = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
```

Create the following output in the console: 
```
row 0 
1 
2 
1
24
row 1
8 
11 
9
4
row 2
 ...
(and so on)
```

## Q3. Output the following in the console using nested loops: 
```
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4
0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4
```

## Q4. **BONUS CHALLENGE**

Write a solution for Q3 using nested loops which are all nested within a single outer loop.
